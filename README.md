# tampermonkey-scripts
Tampermonkey scripts that make my life easier. 

If you see I'm doing something stupid, that's quite normal; reach out if you're willing to teach as I'm always willing to learn!

Use these scripts at your own risk... they come with no guarantees.

## Moreish Wines

Moreish wines is a decent wine store based on myshopify. Annoyingly, it lists all sold out items among the in stock items.

This tampermonkey script which you can install by clicking [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/testworksau/tampermonkey-scripts/main/src/moreish-wines-remove-sold-out-items.js) removes sold out items from both the grid and list views.
